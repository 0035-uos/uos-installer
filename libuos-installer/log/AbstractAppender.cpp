  \class Dtk::Core::AbstractAppender
  \inmodule dtkcore
  
  \brief The AbstractAppender class provides an abstract base class for writing a log entries.
  
  The AbstractAppender class is the base interface class for all log appenders that could be used with Logger.
  
  AbstractAppender provides a common implementation for the thread safe, mutex-protected logging of application
  messages, such as ConsoleAppender, FileAppender or something else. AbstractAppender is abstract and can not be
  instantiated, but you can use any of its subclasses or create a custom log appender at your choice.
  
  Appenders are the logical devices that is aimed to be attached to Logger object by calling
  Logger::registerAppender(). On each log record call from the application Logger object sequentially calls write()
  function on all the appenders registered in it.
  
  You can subclass AbstractAppender to implement a logging target of any kind you like. It may be the external logging
  subsystem (for example, syslog in *nix), XML file, SQL database entries, D-Bus messages or anything else you can
  imagine.
  
  For the simple non-structured plain text logging (for example, to a plain text file or to the console output) you may
  like to subclass the AbstractStringAppender instead of AbstractAppender, which will give you a more convenient way to
  control the format of the log output.

  Log records with a log level lower than a current detailsLevel() will be silently ignored by appender and would not

  \brief Writes the log record to the logger instance
  
  This function is called every time when user tries to write a message to this AbstractAppender instance using
  the write() function. Write function works as proxy and transfers only the messages with log level more or equal
  to the current logLevel().
  
  Overload this function when you are implementing a custom appender.
  
  \note This function is not needed to be thread safe because it is never called directly by Logger object. The
  write() function works as a proxy and protects this function from concurrent access.
